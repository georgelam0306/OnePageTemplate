          <p> CHILDREN&rsquo;S PRIVACY - SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS</p>

          <p>We value your children&rsquo;s privacy.</p>

          <p />

          <p>
            It is important that you understand that we do use social networks
            in our game to allow players who are 13 years old or older to have
            fun by exchanging their gameplay events with other players over the
            age of 13. The Social Networks we use are based on prominent third
            party social networks, like Facebook, Apple&rsquo;s Game Center,
            Google+, and Amazon&rsquo;s GameCircle. We rely on the age
            restrictions from these networks to make sure only players over the
            age of 13 can share information. It is up to you to make sure your
            child is of the required age to be using a social network.
          </p>

          <p />

          <p>
            We do allow players who are 13 years old or older to participate in
            the Forums on our Sites and in surveys to share their experiences of
            playing the game.
          </p>

          <p />

          <p>
            With the exception of information collected from Social Networks,
            Forums, and Surveys, we do not collect any personal identifying
            information in game, including names or email addresses, from
            players, except when we believe a player&rsquo;s safety is at risk.
          </p>

          <p />

          <p>
            The Internet and connected applications offers a world of
            opportunity for children. Your guidance and involvement are
            essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding
            online experience. We encourage you to visit the
            http://getnetwise.org site and look through the &quot;Kids
            Safety&quot; section together. Your efforts to instill responsible
            information practices will help steer your children to
            age-appropriate sites and will go a long way toward ensuring that
            your children have enriching experiences online.

            system, IP addresses, and device identifiers in our Mobile Games
            with the sole purpose of helping us support the internal operations

          <p>YOUR VOICE</p>

          <p>
            We have a feature called &ldquo;Your Voice&rdquo; in some of our
            games that asks users questions about pop culture, current events,
            and other interesting issues. Users can respond with one out of four
            multiple choice answers. There is also the option to skip a
            question. These answers are shared with friends within a
            user&rsquo;s Social Networks. These answers are also aggregated so
            that users can see what users, in aggregate, choose as the most
            popular answers. The answers are purposefully multiple choice
            answers only, so that they do not reveal any personally identifiable
            information.

          <p>
            For parents, involvement in your family's online lives is one of the
            most important safety tools available. In addition, we encourage you
            to educate yourself and your child on privacy concerns. We
            recommend, as a starting point, the following guide published by the
            federal government,
